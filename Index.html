  <section id="getting-started">
    <h2>Getting Started with Real Estate Investing</h2>
    <p>Real estate has long been one of the most reliable ways to build lasting wealth. Unlike stocks or businesses that can vanish overnight, real estate puts a physical asset in your hands — one that generates consistent income and appreciates over time.</p>
    <p>Before jumping in, understand why real estate is so powerful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> Monthly rental income after expenses that puts money in your pocket.</li>
      <li><strong>Appreciation:</strong> Property value grows over time, increasing your net worth.</li>
      <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Use other people’s money (loans) to control valuable assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Advantages:</strong> Government incentives to reward investors through deductions and deferrals.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Tax Playbook Sections -->

  <section id="tax-depreciation">
    <h2>Depreciation & Cost Segregation</h2>
    <p>Depreciation allows you to deduct the cost of your property's structure over 27.5 years, reducing taxable income—even if your property value rises. Cost segregation accelerates this by separating components like appliances or landscaping, allowing bigger deductions earlier, especially for multi-family or commercial properties.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tax-deductions">
    <h2>Expense Deductions & Write-Offs</h2>
    <p>Almost all expenses related to managing rental properties can be deducted. This includes mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance, property management fees, utilities, advertising, and even mileage and phone bills related to your rental business.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tax-1031">
    <h2>1031 Exchange: Defer Capital Gains Tax</h2>
    <p>The 1031 exchange allows you to sell one investment property and buy another like-kind property without paying capital gains tax immediately. This strategy lets you grow your portfolio faster by deferring taxes until you cash out for good.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tax-entity">
    <h2>Entity Structuring & LLCs</h2>
    <p>Holding properties in LLCs protects personal assets from lawsuits and can provide tax benefits. Depending on your portfolio size and income, you might structure as an LLC, S-Corp, or partnership to maximize legal protections and tax efficiency.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tax-professional">
    <h2>Real Estate Professional Status</h2>
    <p>If you or your spouse spend more than 750 hours per year actively managing real estate, you can qualify as a Real Estate Professional with the IRS. This allows you to offset active income with rental losses, creating massive tax savings and possibly paying little to no taxes on your earnings.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tax-qbi">
    <h2>Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction</h2>
    <p>Many rental real estate investors qualify for the QBI deduction, allowing up to 20% off rental income taxes. Proper business structure and record-keeping are essential to qualify and maximize this powerful tax benefit.</p>
